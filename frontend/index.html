      <p>
        Welcome! I am <em>Devvrat Saini</em>, a passionate software developer
        with a knack for creating web and Android applications. With a
        background in computer science, I specialize in back-end development and
        have experience in building dynamic websites using JavaScript, HTML, and
        CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am diving into full-stack development, focusing on
        integrating robust back-end systems with seamless user interfaces. This
        website is where I share my projects, tutorials, and insights into the
        world of coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore my work and reach out to me if you would like to
        collaborate or learn more about my approach to software development.
        When I am not coding, you will find me listening to podcasts or music,
        or sometimes spending time with people I know.
      </p>
