    <p>
      Welcome! I am <em>Devvrat Saini</em>, a passionate software developer with
      a knack for creating web and android applications. With a background in
      computer science, I specialize in back-end development and have experience
      in building dynamic websites using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am diving into full-stack development, focusing on
      integrating robust back-end systems with seamless user interfaces. This
      website is where I share my projects, tutorials, and insights into the
      world of coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my work and reach out to

        ></strong
      >
      if you would like to collaborate or learn more about my approach to
      software development. When I am not coding, you will find me listening to
      podcasts or music, or sometimes spending time with people I know.
